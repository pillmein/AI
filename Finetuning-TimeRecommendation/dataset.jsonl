For patients who have gastric banding, the amount of food they can consume is limited, and nausea and vomiting may further limit nutritional intake early on. More extensive procedures, such as the Roux-en-Y or biliopancreatic diversion with or without a duodenal switch, not only restrict intake but also limit absorption in the small intestine. As a result, deficiencies in vitamins, minerals, and trace elements may develop, leading to a variety of neurologic complications. The peripheral neuropathies best described with a clear-cut cause are an acute, frequently painful neuropathy or polyradiculoneuropathy associated with thiamine deficiency, and an isolated neuropathy or myeloneuropathy associated with deficiencies of either vitamin B12 or copper. Thiamine deficiency tends to occur in the first weeks or months after surgery, vitamin B12 deficiency may develop at any time from a few years to many years after surgery, and copper deficiency tends to be a fairly late complication, developing several years to many years following surgery. Patients who have undergone bariatric surgery may also have an increased risk of developing focal neuropathies, though these are less clearly related to specific nutritional deficiencies.Ideally, one would like to prevent these neuropathies, but there is no consensus of opinion as to what vitamins and micronutrients need to be taken following bariatric surgery. In addition, many patients who take supplements early on fail to maintain the regimen even though some of the neuropathies can occur fairly late. Supplements frequently recommended include a multivitamin, iron, vitamin D, folic acid, calcium citrate, and vitamin B12. Although thiamine is typically included in a multivitamin, the amount is fairly small, so I recommend adding 100 mg daily for at least the first year. Some have suggested zinc supplementation, but this is potentially problematic because exogenous zinc may interfere with copper absorption. Obtaining blood work every 6 months after surgery will help to identify and treat nutritional deficiencies early.For those patients who have had a bariatric procedure and then develop a neuropathy, evaluating levels of thiamine, copper, vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocystine is indicated. In addition, since one deficiency is frequently associated with others, obtaining levels of vitamin A, C, D, K, and E, as well as iron, zinc, selenium, and magnesium is worthwhile. Checking total protein, albumin, and cholesterol also gives a sense of general nutritional status. Occasionally, no clear-cut deficiency of a vitamin, mineral, or trace element can be identified in patients with various peripheral nervous system manifestations. Nevertheless, these patients may have at least some recovery with improving nutritional intake and vitamin supplementation, suggesting that we still do not fully understand how nutritional status affects the peripheral nervous system."}]}

Among various diagnostic approaches, the microbubble test via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a simple, noninvasive method for detecting pulmonary arteriovenous shunts, particularly in hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Although microbubbles are usually administered peripherally, using a Swan-Ganz (SG) catheter to inject microbubbles directly into the pulmonary artery may provide even more definitive diagnostic information. We report a case of a woman in her 60s who was admitted in cardiac arrest after several months of progressive dyspnea and one month of poor appetite. While resuscitation was successful, severe hypoxemia persisted despite intubation, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen therapy. Immediately after resuscitation, TTE revealed no intracardiac shunt but did show microbubbles in both heart chambers. The patient exhibited refractory hypoxemia, high-output status, and pulmonary hypertension. Based on a history of severe dietary irregularities, beriberi heart disease was suspected, and empirical thiamine administration improved pulmonary hypertension and high-output state; however, the hypoxemia remained unresolved. Since microbubbles had been observed in the left heart without an intracardiac shunt, a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt was suspected. Peripheral microbubble testing showed Grade 4 opacification of the left heart three to four heartbeats subsequent to the filling of the right heart. Concerns regarding hemodynamic instability and timing prompted a microbubble test via the already-placed SG catheter. Injection of microbubbles directly into the pulmonary artery again demonstrated Grade 4 opacification in the left heart alone, confirming a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt independent of intracardiac pathways. The patient later died on day six due to irreversible brain damage. The autopsy revealed cirrhosis with histopathological features of autoimmune hepatitis and pulmonary changes suggestive of a pulmonary arteriovenous shunt. Postmortem evaluations indicated low vitamin B1 levels, consistent with beriberi heart disease, and the presence of autoimmune markers suggesting Sjögren's syndrome. In beriberi heart disease, high output is associated with reduced vascular resistance and increased metabolic demand. In liver disease, excessive nitric oxide and carbon monoxide production may worsen these hemodynamic conditions, promoting pulmonary vasodilation and pulmonary arteriovenous shunt formation. Using the SG catheter for the microbubble test proved practical and effective, especially when standard peripheral methods are complicated by hemodynamic instability, difficulty visualizing the right heart, the potential presence of intracardiac shunts, or contraindications to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). This technique, relying on commonly available cardiovascular equipment, may facilitate earlier diagnosis of shunt-related diseases in complex clinical scenarios."}]}

Patients with psoriasis experience a well-known clinical phenomenon of 'winter severity and summer relief', in which seasonal environmental factors play critical roles in the onset and progression of psoriasis. These factors include temperature, humidity, infection, light exposure and psychological stress. Seasonal changes in temperature and humidity can compromise skin barrier function and exacerbate inflammatory responses, thereby worsening psoriasis symptoms. Notably, during the winter, decreased light exposure leads to reduced vitamin D (VD) levels, reaching their lowest levels from late winter to early spring. This decline in VD levels is associated with increased disease activity, greater disease severity and more frequent flare-ups in patients with psoriasis. During the winter, influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are more prevalent, which can further exacerbate psoriasis symptoms. Moreover, the environmental conditions in winter can trigger or intensify feelings of depression, which may adversely affect psoriasis through the brain-skin axis. In this comprehensive review, we thoroughly examined the influence of seasonal environmental factors on the incidence, recurrence and severity of psoriasis. By clarifying these complex relationships, we aimed to support the future development of more personalised and effective treatment and management strategies for patients with psoriasis."}]}

The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp, and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of the aerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0-4.0 g/kg, protein 1.2-2.0 g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at 24 h, prior to weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2% loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber intake of <10 g/day for 4 days. 10. During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision (optimally ~2-4% of body mass within 24 h of weigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-90 mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in. 13.

It is an element of the extracellular matrix; it is involved in collagen synthesis, bone mineralization, and immune system modulation; and it reduces metal accumulation in Alzheimer's disease and the risk of atherosclerosis. Given its poor intestinal absorption, Si is ingested in the form of orthosilicic acid (OSA) to promote its bioavailability. The aim of this work was to compare different commercial dietary supplements containing stabilized OSA to ascertain their bioaccessibility, bioavailability, and safety in a model of human intestinal epithelium. Biocompatibility with the glycocalyx was also investigated. Supplements containing collagen, maltodextrins, and choline as OSA stabilizers were analyzed. Bioaccessibility was explored by means of an in vitro digestive process. Bioavailability was investigated using a Caco2 cell line alone, or co-culturing with a HT29-MTX cell line. The safety of the compounds tested (in terms of intestinal epithelium integrity) was judged on the grounds of MTS assay, transepithelial electrical resistance, and apparent permeability. The three formulations were also tested in a Caco2 cell model of intestinal glycocalyx Si retention. The choline-formulated OSA formulation outperformed the maltodextrin-stabilized supplement, with a Si bioavailability about 14 times higher (P < .05). The choline-formulated OSA formulation increased cell permeability, with consequent intestinal epithelium disruption. The supplements' absorption and bioavailability (and harmfulness) differed considerably, depending on the OSA stabilizer involved. Of the three formulations tested, the collagen-formulated OSA represents the best Si dietary supplement."}]}

Regarding hair benefits, it was suggested that a higher silicon content in the hair results in a lower rate of hair loss and increased brightness. For these beneficial effects, there is growing interest in scientific studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of using dietary supplements containing silicon. Its use aims at increasing blood levels of this element and improving the skin and its annexes appearance. There are different forms of silicon supplements available and the most important consideration to be made in order to select the best option is related to safety and bioavailability. Silicon supplements are widely used, though there is wide variation in silicon bioavailability, ranging from values below 1% up to values close to 50%, depending on the chemical form. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the scientific literature related to the different chemical forms of silicon supplements available and the limitations and recent progress in this field.

The classic sequence of events begins with a deficit of calcitriol synthesis and retention of phosphorus. As a result of this, serum calcium decreases and parathyroid hormone (PTH) is stimulated, producing in the bone the high turnover (HT) bone disease known as osteitis fibrosa while on the other extreme we find the forms of low turnover (LT) bone disease. Described later and initially associated with aluminum intoxication, these diseases are now seen primarily in older and/or diabetic patients, who in a uremic setting have relatively low levels of PTH to maintain normal bone turnover. Osteomalacia is also included in this group, which after the disappearance of aluminum intoxication is rarely observed. LT forms of hyperparathyroidism facilitate the exit of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) from bone, whereas the adynamic bone limits the incorporation of Ca and P into bone tissue. Therefore, both forms facilitate the availability of Ca and P, which ends up being deposited in soft tissues such as arteries. The link between bone disease and vascular calcifications in CKD is now a well-established phenomenon. 2. Diagnostic strategies Calcium, Phosphorus They have little capacity to predict underlying bone disease, but their regular measurement is decisive for therapeutic management of the patient, especially in the dose titration stages of intestinal phosphorus binders, vitamin D analogs or calcimimetics. Ideally, Ca++ should be used, but total Ca is routinely used. It is recommended to adjust albumin levels in the event of hypoalbuminemia (for each g/dL of decrease in albumin, total serum Ca decreases 0.9 mg/dL). The following formula facilitates rapid calculation of corrected total calcium: Corrected total Ca (mg/dL) = total Ca (mg/dL) + 0.8 [4-albumina (g/dL)]. Parathyroid hormone \"Intact\" PTH is the biochemical parameter that best correlates with bone histology (levels measured with the Allegro assay from Nichols Institute Diagnostics, no longer available). Various assays are currently available that use antibodies against different fragments of the molecule, but they have significant intermethod variability and have not been validated. A whole PT assay (1-84) is currently unavailable. A consensus to establish uniform criteria for PTH measurement remains to be established. During the dose titration stages of intestinal phosphorus binders, vitamin D analogs or calcimimetics, more frequent measurement may be required based on clinical judgment. Calcifediol (25(OH)D3) It is important to maintain adequate levels of 25(OH)D3 (> 30 ng/mL), since they will be the substrate for production of 1- 25(OH)2 D3, and their deficiency aggravates hyperthyroidism. Determining 25(OH)D3 levels every 6-12 months is a recommended guideline. Other markers of bone turnover (osteocalcin, total and bone alkaline phosphate, free pyridolines in serum, and C-terminal telopeptide of collagen) do not improve the predictive power of PTH and therefore their systematic use is not justified. Radiologic studies Radiologic studies are of little diagnostic utility, because biochemical changes precede radiologic changes. Systematic radiologic evaluation of the skeleton in asymptomatic patients is not justified at present. They are useful as the first step in the study to detect vascular calcifications and amyloidosis due to b2-microglobulin and in symptomatic and at risk patients to detect vertebral fractures. Bone densitometry: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the standard method to determine bone mineral density (usually in the femoral neck and vertebrae). It provides information on changes in bone mineral content, but not on the type of underlying bone disease. It is useful for follow-up of bone mass or for the study of bone mass changes in the same patient. Its value as a predictor of the risk of fracture has not been demonstrated in patients on kidney replacement therapy or with advanced chronic kidney disease. It is indicated in patients with fractures or risk factors for osteoporosis. Bone biopsy: The \"gold standard\" for diagnosis of bone disease.

Caffeine determination was also carried out to provide information about green tea intake for all age-groups of children and pregnant women. Determining the quantity of each catechin was difficult because of degradation, polymerization, and isomerization that had occurred during heat-drying in the refining process. In addition, the absorption of catechin compounds was tested using miniature swine because of their functional and physiological similarity to humans. Benifuki tea leaves contained epigallocatechin-3-(3\"-O-methyl) gallate (EGCg3\"Me) instead of epigallocatechin-3-(4\"-O-methyl) gallate (EGCg4\"Me). However, EGCg4\"Me was detected during the entire intake period, but EGCg3\"Me was not detected in the blood of miniature swine fed Benifuki tea.

Underscoring this premise, our studies in AD transgenic mice show that long-term caffeine administration protects against cognitive impairment and reduces brain amyloid-β levels/deposition through suppression of both β- and γ-secretase. Because coffee contains many constituents in addition to caffeine that may provide cognitive benefits against AD, we examined effects of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee on plasma cytokines, comparing their effects to caffeine alone. In both AβPPsw+PS1 transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates, acute i.p. treatment with caffeinated coffee greatly and specifically increased plasma levels of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF), IL-10, and IL-6. Neither caffeine solution alone (which provided high plasma caffeine levels) or decaffeinated coffee provided this effect, indicating that caffeine synergized with some as yet unidentified component of coffee to selectively elevate these three plasma cytokines. The increase in GCSF is particularly important because long-term treatment with coffee (but not decaffeinated coffee) enhanced working memory in a fashion that was associated only with increased plasma GCSF levels among all cytokines. Since we have previously reported that long-term GCSF treatment enhances cognitive performance in AD mice through three possible mechanisms (e.g., recruitment of microglia from bone marrow, synaptogenesis, and neurogenesis), the same mechanisms could be complimentary to caffeine's established ability to suppress Aβ production. We conclude that coffee may be the best source of caffeine to protect against AD because of a component in coffee that synergizes with caffeine to enhance plasma GCSF levels, resulting in multiple therapeutic actions against AD."}]}

Peptidylglycine monooxygenase (PHM) is a copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes C-alpha hydroxylation of a glycine-extended pro-peptide, a critical post-translational step in peptide amidation. A canonical mechanism based on experimental and theoretical considerations proposes that molecular oxygen reacts at the mononuclear CuM-center to form a reactive Cu(II)-superoxo intermediate capable of H-atom abstraction from the peptidyl substrate, followed by long range ET from the CuH center positioned 11 Å away across a solvent-filled cleft. However, recent data has challenged this mechanism, suggesting instead that an \"open-to-closed\" conformational transition brings the copper centers closer to facilitate reaction at a binuclear copper site. Here we present direct observations of an enzyme-bound binuclear copper species, which was enabled by the use of an Ala-Ala-Phe-homoselenocysteine (hSeCys) species. EXAFS, UV/vis, and EPR studies are used to show that this reagent reacts with the oxidized enzyme to form a novel mixed valence entity which is subtly different from that observed previously for the S-peptidyl complex (K.

However, their differing effects on the bioavailability of As, Cd, and Se and their absorption by rice are still poorly understood. In this study, PGP Agrobacterium sp. T3F4 with Se- oxidizing capacity and corn straw biochar were applied to natively polluted paddy soil. Strain T3F4 reduced the bioavailability of As in soil but increased bioavailable Se, decreasing the As content in rice by 16.8% and improving the Se content of rice by 54.5% (p < .05). Application of 2.5% biochar stimulated iron (Fe) plaque formation of the root and immobilized As and Cd in the soil, decreasing the As and Cd absorption of rice by 14.7% and 40.3%, respectively (p < .05). Application of 5.0% biochar achieved similar mitigation effects for As and Cd but also decreased the Se content in rice by 60.6% by reducing bioavailability. This decrease in Se uptake was mitigated when 5.0% biochar was co-applied with strain T3F4. Notably, applying strain T3F4 also alleviated the oxidative stress on rice plants and enhanced soil enzyme activities, contributing to a substantial increase in grain yield in the polluted paddy soil. The adverse effects of 5.0% biochar on soil health and grain yield were mitigated by the co-application of strain T3F4. Our results provide new insights into applying PGPB and biochar for Se biofortification and As and Cd remediation in paddy soil."}]}

Organoselenium species, although hypothesized to be more bioavailable than oxyanions, have rarely been identified or quantified in natural waters and little is known about their fate or bioaccumulative potential. We studied spatial patterns of bioaccumulation in relation to aqueous Se speciation over 5 years at more than 100 locations near coal mine operations in southeast British Columbia, Canada. We used a sequential approach to fitting bioaccumulation model coefficients, first using sites with no detectable organic Se species (< 0.01 µg L-1) to describe the bioaccumulation of selenate and selenite, then applying those relationships to the remaining sites to infer the bioavailability of detectable organoselenium species. Our analysis indicated that the methylated species methylseleninic acid was the most bioaccumulative form, followed by dimethylselenoxide. Organoselenium species were associated primarily with mine sedimentation ponds and are presumed to be products of Se metabolism by algae and bacteria. Highly bioavailable organoselenium species exported from the ponds appear to be responsible for enhanced Se bioaccumulation in biota in downstream lotic reaches, with this influence diminishing with distance from ponds as concentrations decline. Our findings indicate that managing biological productivity in mine sedimentation ponds could help manage Se risk in the receiving environment."}]}
