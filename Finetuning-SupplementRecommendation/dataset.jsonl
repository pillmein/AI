Although there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutics, promising results from recent induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cell (iNSC) studies have demonstrated decreased tissue damage and functional deficits in pre-clinical TBI models. Moreover, while the rest has been traditionally identified as the standard of care following TBI, research now suggests that physical activity postinjury may significantly enhance neuroprotective and regenerative signaling in patients. Combining these two therapies may therefore synergistically improve recovery outcomes in TBI patients. In this study, we evaluated the combined therapeutic efficacy of iNSCs and structured treadmill walking on cellular, tissue, and functional recovery in a translational pediatric pig TBI model. One-month-old piglets received a controlled cortical impact-induced TBI and were randomly assigned to either a PBS (n = 4), PBS + treadmill (n = 4), iNSC (n = 4), or iNSC + treadmill (n = 4) treatment group. Piglets received intraparenchymal transplantations of either iNSCs or PBS 5 days post-TBI. At 1-week post-transplantation, piglets assigned to the treadmill treatment groups began a 12-week progressive walking regimen. Motor function and open field behavior assessments were performed pre-TBI and 12 weeks post-transplantation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological evaluation of collected brain tissue were performed 12 weeks post-transplantation. Immunohistochemistry revealed long-term survival, engraftment, and differentiation of transplanted iNSCs into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in treated piglets. Furthermore, iNSC + treadmill treatment showed increased endogenous neuron and oligodendrocyte survival, increased proliferation of neuroblasts, and decreased populations of reactive astrocytes and immune cells in TBI brain tissue. MRI analysis revealed a significant reduction in lesion volume, midline shift, and white matter degradation with preserved cerebral blood flow following both iNSC and iNSC + treadmill interventions. These cellular and tissue-level effects corresponded with significant motor function recovery as seen through increased step and stride length with decreased stance percentage and time. During open field behavioral assessments, iNSC and iNSC + treadmill-treated piglets demonstrated improved exploratory behaviors. These findings suggest that the combination of iNSCs with structured treadmill walking significantly enhanced TBI recovery beyond the therapeutic potential of iNSCs or exercise alone. Therefore, this novel combination therapy needs to be further explored as a potential transformative treatment option for pediatric TBI patients."}]}

This cell population comprises a mixed population of basal cells (BCs), the predominant stem cell in airways capable of both self-renewal and functional differentiation. Despite their potential for regenerative medicine, BCs exhibit significant phenotypic variability in culture. To investigate how culture conditions influence BC phenotype and function, we expanded three independent BC isolates in three media: airway epithelial cell growth medium (AECGM), dual-SMAD inhibitor (DSI)-enriched AECGM, and PneumaCult Ex plus (PEx+). Analysis through RNA sequencing, immune assays, and impedance measurements revealed that PEx+ media significantly drove cell proliferation and a broad proinflammatory phenotype in BCs. In contrast, BCs expanded in AECGM and displayed increased expression of structural and extracellular matrix components at higher passage. AECGM increased expression of some cytokines at high passage, whereas DSI suppressed inflammation implicating the involvement TGF-β in BC inflammatory processes. Differentiation capacity of BCs declined with time in culture irrespective of expansion media. This was associated with an increase in PLUNC expressing secretory cells in AECGM and PEx+ media consistent with the known immune modulatory role of PLUNC in the airways. These findings highlight the profound impact of media conditions on inflammatory niche established by, and function of, in vitro expanded BCs. The broad proinflammatory phenotype driven by PEx+ media, in particular, should be considered in the development of cell-based models for airway diseases and therapeutic applications."}]}

However, the extent of subcortical morphometric changes linked to meditation practice is less appreciated. A noteworthy candidate is the pineal gland, a key producer of melatonin, which regulates circadian rhythms that augment sleep-wake patterns and may also provide neuroprotective benefits to offset cognitive decline. Increased melatonin levels, as well as increased fMRI BOLD signal in the pineal gland, have been observed in meditators versus controls. However, it is not known if long-term meditators exhibit structural changes in the pineal gland linked to the lifetime duration of practice. In the current study, we performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to investigate: (1) whether long-term meditators (LTMs) (n = 14) exhibited greater pineal gland MRI-derived signal intensity compared to a control group (n = 969), (2) a potential association between the estimated lifetime hours of meditation (ELHOM) and pineal gland signal intensity, and (3) whether LTMs show greater grey matter (GM) maintenance (BrainPAD) that is associated with pineal gland signal intensity. The results revealed greater pineal gland signal intensity and lower BrainPAD scores (younger brain age) in LTMs compared to controls. Exploratory analysis revealed a positive association between ELHOM and greater signal intensity in the pineal gland but not with GM maintenance as measured by BrainPAD score. However, greater pineal signal intensity and lower BrainPAD scores were correlated in LTMs. The potential mechanisms by which meditation influences pineal gland function, hormonal metabolism, and GM maintenance are discussed - in particular, melatonin's roles in sleep, immune response, inflammation modulation, and stem cell and neural regeneration."}]}

Emotional and neutral images appeared at fixation, and healthy participants varying in self-reported anxiety were required to respond to a target elsewhere on the screen.

Synbiotics combine the two. These components may be found in foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fermented foods like yogurt and pickles, or pharmaceutical preparations and functional meals made specifically to improve gut health. Consolidating current knowledge and study findings, this paper examines the body of literature on the impact of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on women's health. Thus, these components' advantageous modes of action are examined, offering insight into how they support the general well-being of the GIT and, consequently, the host. Probiotics, for instance, are crucial for restoring the gut flora. Conversely, prebiot-ics are thought to be a dietary source that promotes the development and activity of good bacteria. This promotes the synthesis of fatty acids, which are essential for a healthy gut and have anti-inflammatory properties, and increases microbial diversity. By combining the ad-vantages of pre and probiotics, the synergistic impact of synbiotics makes them a more po-tent strategy for boosting gut flora and promoting health outcomes. These include probiotics, which have been shown to alleviate the symptoms of GIT disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Additionally, it is known to help prebiotics improve gut health by boosting beneficial bacteria that improve immunity and digestion. Synbiotics stimulate immunity, enhance nutrient absorption, and encourage good digestion by encouraging a varied and balanced gut microbiota. This in turn aids in the treat-ment of particular medical conditions including menopause, challenging high-risk pregnan-cies, and hormonal changes.

Ammonia is the waste product of amino acid degradation and cannot be excreted via urine. Ammonia is metabolized to water-soluble urea via the urea cycle. Hyperammonaemia not only occurs during acute liver failure, but also in rare genetically determined defects of enzymes or transporters involved in the urea cycle resulting in elevated ammonia concentrations. Enzyme defects include deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthase, N-acetylglutamate synthase, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate lyase and arginase, transporter defects are citrin deficiency and HHH-syndrome. These urea cycle defects (UCD) mostly manifest for the first time during the neonatal period, infancy or childhood, however first clinical manifestations including encephalopathy may be observed in adulthood in milder forms. Therefore, physicians treating adults should be aware of clinical symptoms in UCD to make a timely diagnosis and initiate treatment. In adulthood, clinical symptoms are often uncharacteristic including headache, avoidance of high-protein food, psychiatric symptoms triggered by heavy exercise or delivery of a child, autism, attention deficit, lethargy, developmental delay and epilepsy. Elevated ammonia concentrations in blood are the biochemical hallmark. Some UCDs can be diagnosed at metabolite level, others only at genetic level. Treatment consists of eucaloric, low-protein diet supplemented with essential amino acids and vitamins/trace elements, and intake of arginine or citrulline. Pharmacological scavengers of nitrogen are benzoate and butyrate. If conservative therapy fails, hemodialysis should be considered. Prompt treatment during acute crises is essential for optimal outcome. Liver transplantation is considered in metabolically unstable patients.

As low serum vitamin D level was found in association with various neurologic and non-neurologic disorders, it may be associated with migraine as well. This study was designed to determine the association between low serum vitamin D levels and migraine. This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in the Department of Neurology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from July 2019 to June 2021. Total 328 patients were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria following informed written consent and divided into two groups. One hundred and sixty-four (164) migraine patients were enrolled in migraine group and same number of age and gender-matched apparently healthy individuals were included in non-migraine group. Detailed history taking and clinical examinations were done and serum vitamin D level was measured in all participants. Demographic variables of both groups were calculated without any significant difference. The mean serum vitamin D level was measured 16.11±6.33 ng/ml in case group and 23.13±8.71 ng/ml in control group with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). A significant difference was also found in relation to the frequency of migraine attacks (18.49±6.70 ng/ml with ≤3 episodes/month and 14.84±5.76 ng/ml with >3 episodes/month, p<0.001). Mean serum vitamin D was measured lower in moderate and severe disease (23.67±4.86 ng/ml in mild disease, 19.79±5.97 ng/ml in moderate disease,12.94±4.24 ng/ml in severe disease, p<0.001). No significant difference in serum vitamin D level was found in terms of presence or absence of aura. But serum vitamin D level was significantly lower in migraine patients having positive family history (p=0.002). Considering the above findings, it is evident that serum vitamin D level is most likely to be associated with migraine. Early detection of low serum vitamin D levels and measures to correct it may be an adjunctive management strategy in migraine."}]}

Physicians face the challenge to find single, extremely rare PAD patients/families among the millions of individuals with common allergic diseases. We describe case scenarios with signature PAD. We review the literature and deduct specific clinical red flags for PAD detection. They include a positive family history and/or signs of pathological susceptibility to infections, immunodysregulation, or syndromic disease. Results of conventional laboratory and most immunological lab studies are not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of PAD. In the past, multistep narrowing of differential diagnoses by various immunological and other laboratory tests led to testing of single genes or gene panel analyses, which was a time-consuming and often unsuccessful approach. The implementation of whole-genomic analyses in the routine diagnostics has led to a paradigm shift. Upfront genome-wide analysis by whole genome sequencing (WGS) will shorten the time to diagnosis, save patients from unnecessary investigations, and reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose a rational, clinical landmark-based approach for deciding which cases pass the filter for carrying out early WGS. WGS result interpretation requires a great deal of caution regarding the causal relationship of variants in PAD phenotypes and absence of proof by adequate functional tests. In case of negative WGS results, a re-iteration attitude with re-analyses of the data (using the latest data base annotation)) may eventually lead to PAD diagnosis. PAD, like many other rare genetic diseases, will only be successfully managed, if physicians from different clinical specialties and geneticists interact regularly in multidisciplinary conferences."}]}

It affects almost all body systems and has a wide variety of clinical presentations from being asymptomatic to, in rare cases, life threatening. The classic symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, lethargy, weight gain, and cold intolerance; however, these symptoms are non-specific and the diagnosis is typically made on biochemical grounds through serum thyroid function tests. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), although other causes, including drugs (such as amiodarone, lithium, and immune checkpoint inhibitors), radioactive-iodine treatment, and thyroid surgery, are frequent. Historically, severe iodine deficiency was the most common cause. Reference ranges for thyroid function tests are based on fixed percentiles of the population distribution, but there is increasing awareness of the need for more individualised reference intervals based on key factors such as age, sex, and special circumstances such as pregnancy. Levothyroxine monotherapy is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism; it is safe and inexpensive, restores thyroid function tests to within the reference range, and improves symptoms in the majority of patients. However, 10% of patients have persistent symptoms of ill health despite normalisation of thyroid function tests biochemically and a substantial proportion of patients on levothyroxine have thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations outside the reference range. Ongoing symptoms despite levothyroxine treatment has led to some patients using liothyronine or desiccated thyroid extract. Taken together, these factors have led to intense debate around the treatment thresholds and treatment strategies for hypothyroidism. In this Seminar, we review the epidemiology, genetic determinants, causes, and presentation of hypothyroidism; highlight key considerations and controversies in its diagnosis and management; and provide future directions for research."}]}

The present work is aimed at evaluating the styles of coping with stress and their relation to GWG in pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM) for whom sudden adaptation to dietary management during this period can be challenging. It was indicated that women with GDM reported high stress related to potential maternal-fetal complications and worries about compliance with dietary management. The overall weight gain of participants in pregnancy was determined in connection to their prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and classified based on the Institute of Medicine guidelines. A standardized psychological scale was used to assess coping styles.

There were significant correlations between the styles of coping with stress and the GWG. Additionally, low correlations were indicated between emotional, avoidant, task-oriented coping styles and the age of pregnant women with GDM.

This is largely due to the widespread poor dietary quality and inadequate intakes of nutrient-dense foods to meet the heightened requirements for WRA. Food fortification is a cost-effective and highly recommended food-based approach for addressing these micronutrient deficiencies in low-income settings like Africa. The strategy has been implemented at different scales within the region for over three decades. We conducted a review to find evidence of the impact of food fortification implemented at various scales and across different population circumstances in Africa. We also sought to understand what factors may limit the impact of ongoing fortification programs on micronutrient status. We also explored findings regarding the knowledge and acceptability of fortified foods within the African population as a further barrier to the impact of food fortification on nutritional status. We found that fortification with iron and vitamin A was associated with the most variable impact from targeted and large-scale fortification programs. However, significant positive effects on nutritional status and serum biomarkers were found for food fortification with folate, iodine, and zinc among African women. Generally, fortified foods are acceptable to consumers; however, surveys assessing knowledge and preference for fortified foods found that WRA know little about food fortification and its benefits. Poor coverage of fortification, lower levels of fortificants than is recommended, and use of non-WHO recommended fortificants limit the impact of food fortification on micronutrient intakes and status among WRA in Africa. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This review highlights the potential for food fortification to improve the intake of essential and commonly lacking micronutrients among WRA and what factors currently limit this potential in the African region where the highest burden of global micronutrient deficiency among WRA occurs."}]}

POD is associated with various adverse postoperative outcomes, including prolonged hospital stays, higher medical costs and increased morbidity and mortality rates. Moreover, it has been suggested that POD, as an early manifestation of postoperative cognitive impairment, may serve as a precursor to long‑term cognitive dysfunction. Given its considerable clinical impact, the prevention and management of POD are of critical importance. However, the mechanisms underlying POD remain insufficiently understood. Current hypotheses primarily implicate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysregulation and pathological protein changes, such as β‑amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. Disruptions in the sleep‑wake cycle, electroencephalographic burst suppression, the microbiota‑gut‑brain axis, the olfactory‑brain axis and genetic susceptibility to delirium may also contribute to POD occurrence. Multiple signaling pathways are involved in POD, including the Wnt/β‑catenin, PI3K/AKT, brain‑derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B, toll‑like receptor and NF‑κB pathways. These findings not only elucidate potential mechanisms but also highlight essential therapeutic targets and theoretical foundations for clinical management. However, due to the complexity and multifactorial nature of the pathogenesis of POD, no comprehensive or widely accepted clinical measures have yet been established for its prevention and treatment. Both non‑pharmacological and pharmacological interventions have a role in POD prevention and treatment. Non‑pharmacological strategies are currently prioritized, such as cognitive training, the Hospital Elder Life Program and comprehensive geriatric assessment. Pharmacological interventions include dexmedetomidine, melatonin and non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, with intranasal insulin emerging as a promising preventive approach. Additionally, anesthesia management strategies, including depth of anesthesia monitoring, blood pressure regulation and multimodal postoperative analgesia, have also been recognized as effective measures for reducing the risk of POD. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of the pathogenesis of POD, relevant signaling pathways and available preventive and therapeutic strategies. By deepening the understanding of POD, the present review aims to offer practical guidance for clinicians in optimizing prevention and management approaches."}]}

This study aimed to investigate the serotype-specific associations between clinical characteristics and severity of HFMD inpatients. The study utilised a prospective, hospital-based cohort design and a tiered diagnostic algorithm incorporating real-time RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR for serotyping. Clinical data were prospectively collected throughout hospitalization. Clinical severity was measured using diagnoses of central nervous system (CNS) complications and three other outcomes. A total of 1768 inpatients were enrolled consecutively between February 2017 and February 2018. The proportions of CNS complications varied by serotype (p < 0.001), with the highest for EV-A71 (40%), followed by CV-A4 (17%), CV-A2 (13%), CV-A10 (10%), CV-A6 (7%), and CV-A16 (4%). Children with CV-A2 and CV-A4 were less likely to have rashes on hands, feet, or buttocks and more likely to develop high fever, while those with EV-A71 had fewer mouth lesions. Of 230 lab-confirmed HFMD inpatients with CNS complications, EV-A71 accounted for 45% while CV-A6, CV-A16, CV-A4, CV-A10 and CV-A2 accounted for 35%. The logistic regression analysis revealed that non-CNS-specific symptoms such as cold limbs and vomiting, and clinical testing indicators including blood globulin, platelet, serum chloride and neutrophil counts, were associated with CNS complications. Non-EV-A71 EVs can also cause severe diseases, but those with EV-A71 infection are more likely to suffer CNS complications and other severe manifestations.

Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that the consumption of diets rich in carotenoids attenuate cardiometabolic diseases, some types of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory conditions. The bioactive properties of carotenoids depend, at least in part, on their accumulation in target tissues. However, the pathways that drive carotenoid absorption, delivery, and accumulation in tissues remain largely uncharacterized. This review provides a critical overview of the experimental models utilized to monitor carotenoid homeostasis in mammals. We also delve into recent findings concerning carotenoid intestinal uptake, bodily distribution, cellular uptake, and intracellular trafficking. Finally, we discuss the physiological relevance of a fecal carotenoid elimination pathway that operates independently of carotenoid enzymatic cleavage. Establishing the players governing carotenoid biodistribution and elimination is essential to maximize the bioactive properties of carotenoids in humans to prevent chronic diseases."}]}

However, the mechanism underlying retinal cell-specific effects of LHON-linked mtDNA mutations remains poorly understood, and there has been no effective treatment or cure for this disorder. Using a mouse model bearing an LHON-linked ND6P25L mutation, we demonstrated that the mutation caused retinal cell-specific deficiencies, especially in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), rods, and Müller cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed cell-specific dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and visual signaling pathways in the mutant retina. Strikingly, ND6 mutation-induced dysfunctions caused abnormal vitamin A (VA) metabolism essential for visual function. VA supplementation remarkably alleviated retinal deficiencies, including reduced fundus lesion and retinal thickness and increased numbers of RGCs, photoreceptors, and Müller cell neurites. The restoration of visual functions with VA treatment were further evidenced by correcting dysregulations of phototransduction cascade and neurotransmitter transmission and restoring electrophysiological properties. Interestingly, VA supplementation markedly rescued the abnormal mitochondrial morphologies and functions in the mutant retina. These findings provide insight into retina-specific pathophysiology of mitochondrial retinopathy arising from VA deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by mtDNA mutation and a step toward therapeutic intervention for LHON and other mitochondrial retinopathies."}]}

The first study suggests that the weight loss medication semaglutide can improve pain and function in patients with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA), potentially providing a novel approach to management of this condition. The results of the second study show that methotrexate, a proven therapy for inflammatory arthritis, has promise for improving pain in patients with knee OA. The third study establishes that a trial of resistance training does not provide similar benefits as total joint replacement for patients with hip OA. The fourth study finds that platelet-rich plasma injections are no more effective than exercise in reducing pain for patients with knee OA. The fifth study underscores the importance of screening for lung cancer in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly in those known to have interstitial lung disease. The results of the sixth study emphasize that exercise therapy is safe and effective at improving function in patients with RA and severe activity limitations. The seventh study highlights the increased short-term risk for acute cardiovascular events in patients experiencing a new gout diagnosis. The final study suggests that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may provide sustained protection against developing new autoimmune diseases.

Increasing evidence suggests that age-related alterations in metabolite levels are crucial for the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we analyzed serum metabolites from mice of various ages (2, 4, 14, and 21 months old) using mass spectrometry. We identified palmitoyl-L-carnitine as a key metabolite with significantly increased levels in aged mice. In vitro experiments with SH-SY5Y neuronal cells demonstrated that palmitoyl-L-carnitine treatment enhanced tau phosphorylation, increased mitochondrial fission, and elevated intracellular calcium levels. Furthermore, the increased levels of tau phosphorylation were significantly reduced by the inhibition of GSK-3β, CDK5, and calpain, indicating that tau kinases activated by calcium overload are directly involved in the increase of tau phosphorylation. Considering that mitochondrial fission is related to mitochondrial dysfunction, we propose that the elevated level of serum palmitoyl-L-carnitine during aging contributes to AD pathology through these pathways. These findings highlight the significant role of lipid metabolism in neurodegeneration and offer potential therapeutic targets for age-related diseases, including AD."}]}

Animals received their respective treatment for 14 days (intraperitoneally, once daily). After 14 days, animals were subjected to different behavioral tests including light-dark box activity, elevated plus maze test (for anxiety), and tail suspension test (for depression). A Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate short-term and long-term memory performance. After behavioral tests, decapitation was performed and brains were collected and stored for biochemical and neurochemical analysis. Behavioral analysis revealed that Nn alleviated the anxiety and depression-like symptoms and memory decline induced by D-Gal. D-Gal-induced decreased antioxidant enzymes, and acetylcholine levels, while increased oxidative stress markers, neuro-inflammatory cytokines, serotonin metabolism, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were prevented by Nn administration at both doses.
